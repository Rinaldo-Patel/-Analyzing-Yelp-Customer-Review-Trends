Executive Summary: This study leverages real Yelp data, SQL, and Google Cloud tools (Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Vertex AI) to analyze customer satisfaction trends and offer actionable insights for restaurant owners. By focusing on factors such as service quality, menu variety, ambiance, pricing, and accessibility, the analysis identifies strategies for improving Yelp ratings and enhancing customer experiences. Additionally, it highlights regional and demographic patterns that can guide targeted marketing and operational improvements.
Yelp reviews showed steady growth from 2005 to 2019, peaking in 2018, before declining sharply in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Elite users play a critical role in shaping trends, contributing nearly 400 reviews on average compared to 34 by non-elite users. These influential users also garner more “useful” votes, fans, and compliments, making them key advocates for businesses. Restaurants should actively engage elite users through personalized interactions and exclusive offers to amplify their reputation and visibility.
Accessibility emerged as a crucial factor, with wheelchair-accessible locations receiving the highest ratings and review counts. This demonstrates the value of inclusivity and high operational standards in driving customer satisfaction. Seasonal peaks in reviews during July, August, and January, and high activity on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, highlight the importance of optimizing service and promotions during these periods. Encouraging detailed positive reviews and spotlighting "cool" or "useful" feedback can further enhance engagement and guide businesses in improving their offerings. By prioritizing quality service, adapting to trends, and fostering strong customer relationships, restaurant owners can build loyalty and maintain a competitive edge in a dynamic dining landscape.

Main objectives

In today's world of online delivery and food delivery apps, established restaurants have access to a wealth of data that can help them improve and grow based on customer feedback. However, this abundance of information also creates challenges for current businesses in identifying key areas for improvement and may seem daunting to future restaurant owners, especially in a highly competitive market like the United States. To succeed, businesses need insightful analysis to better market themselves and enhance their ratings, as many people rely on online reviews to decide where to dine. In this study, we analyze real data from a popular customer review website, Yelp, to understand sentiment and satisfaction scores across the platform, offering insights that can help restaurant owners make informed decisions to elevate their establishments.

This study provides actionable insights into customer preferences, behavior patterns, and areas for improvement, enabling businesses to refine their offerings and enhance customer satisfaction. In an era where online reviews significantly shape a restaurant’s reputation, leveraging these insights is vital for building customer trust and loyalty.
This analysis delves into key themes that matter most to business owners, such as understanding how user engagement drives visibility, identifying trends in customer reviews, and uncovering factors contributing to customer loyalty and repeat business. It also highlights how restaurants have navigated challenges like the pandemic, showcasing strategies used by high-performing establishments to maintain or improve their ratings over time. Additionally, the study explores how location and customer demographics influence star ratings and reviews attributes like usefulness or humor, offering practical takeaways for targeted marketing and service improvements.
